<b>Order &amp; Referral by Form - Implementation Guide</b>
<b>(CH:ORF)<br /></b>
</p>
<p><b>Introduction to this Implementation Guide</b>
</p>
<p>This Implementation Guide uses FHIR defined resources – Composition Resource, Questionnaire Resource,
    QuestionnaireResponse Resource, Patient Resource, Practitioner Resource, ServiceRequest Resource and Bundle from
    FHIR R4. For details on HL7 FHIR R4 see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free"
        href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r4">http://hl7.org/fhir/r4</a>.
</p>
<p>The Order &amp; Referral by Form (ORF) Implementation Guide describes how forms for eReferrals, requests for
    information (such as diagnostic imaging results, lab results, discharge reports etc.) can be defined, deployed and
    used in order to achieve a syntactical and semantically consistent cross enterprise information exchange.
</p>
<p>The Implementation Guide supports creation and domain wide deployment of forms for structured and coded information
    exchange as well as exchange of such forms for referral, orders etc. The Implementation Guide relies on FHIR e.g.
    the questionnaire resource. Because the Implementation Guide relies heavily on the FHIR Resources Questionnaire and
    QuestionnaireResponse, forms are addressed here as Questionnaires.
</p>
<p>This Implementation Guide is derived from the HL7 Structured Data Capture Implementation Guide, see <a rel="nofollow"
        class="external text" href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/">SDC IG</a> and uses the Swiss Core Profiles, see

<h1><span id="Volume_1_–_Order_&amp;_Referral_by_Form_(CH:ORF)_Implementation_Guide"></span><span class="mw-headline"
        id="Volume_1_.E2.80.93_Order_.26_Referral_by_Form_.28CH:ORF.29_Implementation_Guide">Volume 1 – Order &amp;
        Referral by Form (CH:ORF) Implementation Guide</span></h1>
<p>This Implementation Guide concerns directional information exchange between institutions such as requests for
    referral, requests for previous imaging results, requests for second opinions etc. as well as corresponding
    responses. Such request are often done – or could be done – by means of structured forms. The same may apply for
    responses or documents coming along in case the response consists of a particular payload (e.g. exam results).
    However, forms for these purposes are in general proprietary constructs and seldom suitable for further machine
    processing. Furthermore, such forms are more or less hard coded and concerned systems may not easily be updated for
    new use cases.
</p>
<p>The ORF Implementation Guide addresses two issues:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>It supports a scenario where an authority (e. g. health authority, expert panel etc.) defines a set of forms
        (here called Questionnaires) for well-defined use cases which then are deployed in a specific enterprise, domain
        etc. or even nationwide.</li>
    <li>New use cases or changes in use cases can easily be handled either by modification of existing Questionnaires or
        new ones. The Implementation Guide itself is agnostic to the nature of a particular Questionnaire and the ORF
        Implementation Guide puts only little limits on its definition.</li>
</ol>
<p>Venders implementing the ORF Implementation Guide benefit of a high re-use potential. Applications which support the
    ORF Implementation Guide may be used for various settings of directional information exchange. The specific needs of
    a particular use case will be covered by a adequate design of the Questionnaire and the value sets being used.
</p>
<p>When writing the ORF Implementation Guide, the authors had the following use case in mind: A human fills in a
    Questionnaire for a particular request and sends this Questionnaire to a receiver. There, a human reads the
    Questionnaire with its content. A corresponding response will work in the same way. There is possibly some payload
    coming with the Questionnaire: A request may be accompanied by results of preceding exams (e.g. images, reports);
    the response may be a diagnostic result.
</p>
<p>The primary aim of the ORF Implementation Guide is to assure a consistent representation of Questionnaires at both –
    filler- and receiver – site. But there is the need for further machine processing: at filler site in terms of
    prepopulating attributes with content from other applications (e.g. demographic data of a patient) whereas the
    receiver may want to have the content of the form ready for further processing in his applications. Obviously the
    two aims – semantic interoperability and flexibility in the definition of Questionnaires – are contradictory. The
    ORF Implementation Guide addresses this problem by a mandatory set of mandatory given elements and codes with
    defined meaning which are part of every Questionnaire in the ORF Implementation Guide. It is up to a SDC Form
    Designer to create Questionnaires with additional use case specific elements.
</p>
<p>Applications claiming for conformance with the ORF Implementation Guide shall:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Render (and in case of the Questionnaire filler allow for data entry) all elements of a questionnaire in the
        user interface (e.g. on screen, in print). Grouping of items and the order of items within shall be adequately
        reproduced according to the Questionnaire.</li>
    <li>Be able to process all codes related to the mandatory given elements in a Questionnaire.</li>
</ul>
<p>Venders of applications with Questionnaire Filler/Questionnaire Receiver Actors are strongly recommended to implement
    interfaces to other applications (such as HIS and PACS) for all data in the mandatory given elements of
    Questionnaires.
</p>
<p>Applications designed like this will provide out-of-the-box interconnectivity for mandatory given elements as well as
    out-of-the-box interoperability for all questionnaires as far it concerns user interfaces at filler and receiver
    site.
</p>
<p>Nothing speaks against interfaces for data in the use case specific part of a particular Questionnaire. One has
    however to keep in mind, that such interfaces are tied to a specific questionnaire. Ownership or other means, which
    prevent changes of the questionnaire by third parties, are therefore advisable.
</p>
<p>The ORF Implementation Guide deals with Transport, Workflow and Content. It is based on FHIR resources and in
    particular the FHIR Questionnaire resource. FHIR specifies RESTful Web services as a mean for transport.&#160; An
    implementation based on RESTful Web services is strongly recommended however not mandatory to comply with the ORF
    Implementation Guide. Workflow is addressed by the scope of ORF Implementation Guide which addresses directional
    information exchange with request and response. Content is defined by a set of mandatory mandatory given elements
    and codes and the possibility to extend both as required by the use cases addressed.

<p>Questionnaires and forms permeate healthcare. They are used to capture administrative data, claims data, clinical
    information, research information, for public health reporting - every type of data that is manipulated by
    healthcare systems. They provide a user-friendly mechanism for capturing data in a consistent way. In FHIR, forms
    are represented using the Questionnaire resource and completed forms are represented using the QuestionnaireResponse
    resource. The base FHIR specification defines these resources but doesn't provide much guidance around how they
    should be used, nor does it set minimal expectations for interoperation. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
        href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/">SDC Implementation Guide</a> provides a set of guidance around the use
    of Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse.

    and reports of previous exams. Dr. Miller fills in this questionnaire and sends it back. At S-U-P-E-R-XR, a
    staff
    member will fill in another Questionnaire with a reply, attaches images and reports an sends all to Dr. Miller.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ORF_Security_Considerations">ORF Security Considerations</span></h2>
<p>A resource server should not return any patient information unless proper authentication and communications
    security
    have been proven.
</p>
<p>There are many reasonable methods of securing interoperability transactions. These security models can be layered
    in
    without modifying the characteristics of the ORF Profile transactions. The use of TLS is mandatory.
</p>
<p>User authentication on mobile devices is encouraged using Internet User Authorization (IUA) Profile. The network
    communication security and user authentication are layered in at the HTTP transport layer and do not modify the
    interoperability characteristics defined in the ORF Profile.
</p>
<p>The Security Audit logging (e.g., ATNA) is recommended. Support for ATNA-based audit logging on the mobile health
    device may be beyond the ability of this constrained environment.
</p>
<p>In case vendors decide to include the Patient ID (patient.identifier) as a query parameter on the Resource URL
    (what
    would be out of the scope of ORF Implementation Guide), this URL pattern would present a risk when using typical
    web
    server audit logging of URL requests, and browser history. In both of these cases the URL with the patient
    identity
    would be clearly visible. These risks should be mitigated in system or operational design.

    method composed of a FHIR Bundle Resource containing the Composition resource and all resources referenced in,
    in
    particular one Questionnaire Resource, one QuestionnaireResponse Resource and additional resources according to
    the

<p>On receipt of the submission, the Questionnaire Receiver shall validate the resources and respond with one of the
    HTTP codes defined in Section 3.4.4.2.2 Message Semantics.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_Message">Status Message</span></h4>
<p>The Questionnaire receiver returns a HTTP Status code appropriate to the processing, conforming to the

    specification requirements as specified in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free"
        href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/http.html#transaction">http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/http.html#transaction</a>

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Message_Semantics_2">Message Semantics</span></h5>
<p>When the Questionnaire Receiver has successfully processed the POST transaction, then the Questionnaire Receiver
    shall return an HTTP response with an overall status code.
</p>
<p>In order to allow the Questionnaire Filler to know the outcomes of processing the transaction, and the identities
    assigned to the resources by the Questionnaire Receiver, the Questionnaire Receiver shall return a Bundle, with
    type
    set to transaction-response, that contains one entry for each entry in the request, in the same order, with the
    outcome of processing the entry. See FHIR <a rel="nofollow" class="external free"
        href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/bundle.html#transaction-response">http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/bundle.html#transaction-response</a>
</p>
<p>Each entry element shall contain a response element which details the outcome of processing the entry - the HTTP
    status code. All other elements are not required.
</p>
<p>On success, the Questionnaire Receiver shall return the HTTP status code 200 – OK.
</p>
<p>Guidance on handling Access Denied related to use of 403 and 404 can be found in IHE Appendix on HL7 FHIR Z.7.
</p>
<p>On failure, the Questionnaire Receiver shall return the HTTP status codes as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>400 Bad Request - resource could not be parsed or failed basic FHIR validation rules like reference
        inconsistencies, schema violations, etc.</li>
    <li>404 Not Found - resource type not supported.</li>
    <li>422 Unprocessable Entity - one or more proposed resources violated applicable FHIR profiles or server
        business
        rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Questionnaire Receiver may also send 5xx HTTP status codes to indicate non-transaction related
    failures. Note that the Questionnaire Filler may also encounter non-FHIR endpoints which will not return an
    Bundle
    in the response.
</p>
<p>The Questionnaire Receiver may return HTTP redirect responses (responses with HTTP status codes 301, 302, 303 or
    307)
    in response to a request.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Expected_Actions_2">Expected Actions</span></h5>
<p>If the Questionnaire Receiver returns an HTTP redirect response (HTTP status codes 301, 302, 303, or 307), the
    Questionnaire Filler shall follow that redirection, although it may stop processing if it detects a loop.
</p>
<p>The Questionnaire Receiver processes the results according to application-defined rules.
</p>
<p>If a Questionnaire Receiver cannot automatically recover from an error condition, at a minimum, it should display
    the
    error to the user.

<p>This section describes the content of a form. The following definitions apply:
</p>
<p>Request and responses consist of filled in questionnaires. Some elements of the questionnaire are mandatory given
    elements (such as author, data entry person, receiver etc. are always present in a questionnaire compliant to
    the
    ORF Implementation Guide. In addition, a questionnaire will contain elements which are use case specific. The
    ORF
    Implementation Guide makes no assumptions about the nature of such elements: structure and content (including
    coding
    of codes elements) are in the responsibility of those creating a form for a particular use case.
</p>
<p>As this Implementation Guide is based on FHIR, the following rules apply:
</p>
<p>Items, grouping of items, order of groups and order of elements within groups of a questionnaire shall be defined
    in
    a Questionnaire Resource. The Questionnaire Resource is defined by means of the SDC From Designer and made
    available
    by the SDC Form Manager.
</p>
<p>Based on the Questionnaire, a Questionnaire Filler defines a QuestionnaireResponse and appropriate additional
    resources aimed at transmitting the information provided by the Questionnaire filler in a standardized
    structured
    form. Upon completion of the questionnaire, the Questionnaire Filler shall create a bundle with all resources
    mentioned above.
</p>
<p>Questionnaires may be accompanied by additional material which can be attached or sent by postal mail (e.g.
    xray-films or paper documents). The use case may require some references between attached objects (e. g. which
    pdf-reports belongs to which imaging study).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="FHIR_Representation">FHIR Representation</span></h2>
<p>FHIR depicts forms (questionnaires) in a Questionnaire Resource. A Questionnaire Resource can be conceived as an
    empty questionnaire where as the filled in questionnaire refers to the QuestionnaireResponse Resource.
    QuestionnaireResponse Resources are certainly structured but due to their flexibility in design not in a
    standardized manner. FHIR addresses this issue by means of its standardized resources.
</p>
<p>The Order &amp; Referral by Form Implementation Guide is based on two FHIR Resources profiles. For details on
    profiling FHIR see HL7 FHIR <a rel="nofollow" class="external free"
        href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html</a>. For details on
    FHIR
    resources and data-types see HL7 FHIR <a rel="nofollow" class="external free"
        href="http://hl7.org/fhir/">http://hl7.org/fhir/</a>.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Order &amp; Referral by Form Questionnaire (ORF) Implementation Guide defines the usage of the FHIR
        Questionnaire Resource within the Order &amp; Referral by Form. The Questionnaire Resource is an organized
        collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals
        involved
        in the healthcare domain. They may be simple flat lists of questions or can be hierarchically organized in
        groups and sub-groups, each containing questions. The Questionnaire defines the questions to be asked, how
        they
        are ordered and grouped and what the constraints are on the allowed answers. The results of a Questionnaire
        can
        be communicated using the QuestionnaireResponse resource (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free"
            href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html</a>).</li>
    <li>The Order &amp; Referral by Form Document (ORF) Profile defines the usage of the FHIR Bundle within the
        Order
        &amp; Referral by Form (ORF) Implementation Guide. The ORFDocumentProfile consist of a FHIR document
        (bundle)
        that contains the results of a filled in Questionnaire (QuestionnaireResponse Resource) together with the
        structured resources which map all information filled in the questionnaire. The <a rel="nofollow"
            class="external text" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html">Bundle</a> is of <a rel="nofollow"
            class="external text" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.type">type</a>
        &quot;document&quot; and has a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
            href="http://hl7.org/fhir/composition.html">Composition</a> resource as the first resource in the
        bundle,
        followed by a series of other resources, referenced from the Composition resource. The bundle gathers all
        the
        content of the document into a single XML document which may be signed and managed as required. The
        resources
        include both human readable and computer processable sections. In addition, a bundle as defined in this
        profile
        shall include a CSS stylesheets and optionally it may include a signature.<br /><br />Any resource
        referenced
        directly in the Composition Resource shall be included in the bundle. Other resources that these referenced
        resources refer to shall also be included in the bundle. Including these additional resources will make the
        document bigger, but will save applications from needing to retrieve the linked resources.</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Questionnaire_resource">Questionnaire resource</span></h4>
<p>The intention of the ORF Implementation Guide is to provide a standardized representation of forms at sender and
    receiver site as well. This is achieved with the Questionnaire Resource, which defines representation of all
    elements for the user (with the help of a CSS) and user interaction as well (e.g. with drop down lists).
</p>
<p>This approach requires two things:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Precise definition of all questions</li>
    <li>Mapping between elements of the Questionnaire Resource and the corresponding elements of the other resources
        in
        the bundle</li>
</ol>
<p>Both is achieved by assigning meaningful concepts to all elements concerned. For codes refer to Appendix A.
